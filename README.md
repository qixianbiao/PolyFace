Our Model was trained on the cleaned CASIA Dataset (around 450K).

Three training logs are provided. We will release our code and technical report late.


Currently, the best performance achieved was 99.583% on LFW data set. 

With Titan X Pascal, it tasks around 36 hours to finish 150,000 steps. 
With old Titan X, training 150,000 steps takes around 47 hours.
